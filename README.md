## The challenge

Put into practice everything learned during the first 10 courses by building a website in a 2-week sprint that can cipher and decipher the text entered by the user **according to requirements proposed by the Alura LATAM team.**

## Encoding keys

| Key           | Value                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| a |ai|
| e |enter|
| i |imes|
| o |ober|
| u |ufat|

And vice versa.

## Requirements

* Only lowercase letters and without accents are accepted.
* It must be possible to convert a word and for the encrypted version to return the original version.
* The page must have fields for inserting the text to be encoded or decoded, and the user must be able to choose between both options.
* The result must be displayed on the screen.
* It must contain a button that copies the resulting text (having the same functionality as ctrl + c).


## The design
[This is the design](https://www.figma.com/file/trP3p5nEh7XUyB3n2bomjP/Alura-Challenge---Desaf%C3%ADo-1---L%C3%B3gica?node-id=0%3A1) made in Figma that we received to build on or otherwise we could make a customized one.
